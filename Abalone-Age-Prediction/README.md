## Abalone Age Prediction

The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.

The analysis here uses (1) a GradientBoostingRegressor model and (2) a neural network to predict the age (number of rings) of the abalone.
