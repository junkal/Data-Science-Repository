Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29), this scripts uses a few machine learning techniques to help classify the diagnosed patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. 
A Support Vector Machine is being implemented with 99% accuracy.
